## PyMBAR A Python implementation of the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR)


This is basically a minified version of the PyMAR SVN repository from https://simtk.org/home/pymbar

I just added a setup.py script so that it can be easily installed on your system.

    python setup.py install


*Note: the original README is in README.pymbar*
